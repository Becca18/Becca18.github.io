title: Predictions in the Film Industry

##  Can we predict the number of US theaters in which a foreign language film will be released using regression? 

During the last 2 weeks, we focused on the following data science topics:  
* Web Scraping (publicly available data)  
* Linear Regression  
* Regularization   
* Train & Test  
* Probability  
* Bayes  
* Visualization with Matplotlib 

And we learned the following Python libraries:  
* NumPy - library for performing high-level mathematical functions on arrays and matrices   
* stats models - library for exploring data and performing statistical tests  
* scikit-learn - library for many machine learning techniques and data mining  
* Beautiful Soup - library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files  

Our task was to see if we could learn key insights about the movie industry using regression models. The question I posed to myself is whether I could predict the number of US theaters in which a foreign language film will be released using regression. What components of a film help predict the number of US theaters in which a foreign language film will be released? Is there a positive or negative relationship with each component and how strong is each relationship?  

Drumrollâ€¦ this was definitely harder than I thought it would be!  The answer is no. I cannot predict very well the number of US theaters in which a foreign language film will be released using regression.
