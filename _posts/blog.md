##Metis - Week 1  

I was super excited to start Metis this week! A data science education has been something I’ve wanted since 2006 when I first became interested in operations research and data analytics. 10 years later I am finally learning the techniques that will help me land a data science role at a forward-thinking company.

At Metis, I’m surrounded by some really smart and down-to-earth individuals. It’s fun to hear everyone’s stories and how they came to be at Metis to join the 4th San Francisco cohort. 

My instructors are fantastic so far. You can tell that they enjoy teaching and want to impart their wisdom on all of us data science newbies.

Every morning we embark on pair programming for one or two Python problems. At first, I found this to be a little bit difficult. I learned Python on my own this summer, working out problems in my mind silently for hours upon hours. So it was difficult for me to get over being shy and to speak my thoughts aloud (no matter how crazy they are!). However, you very quickly learn that two heads are better than one, and you will be able to solve a problem a lot quicker with two people working together. By the end of the week, I looked forward to the morning pair programming and learning from my partner. 

This first week we learned Pandas - a library for manipulating and exploring data (aka “data munging”) in Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

One thing I’ve realized is that you could spend your entire life learning all there is to learn about data science (and millions of other topics). It’s key to know where to find the information when you need it, rather than trying to memorize every little detail.
