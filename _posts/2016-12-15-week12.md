###  Can we detect melanoma in images of skin abnormalities?  

#####  Passion Project Time!  
During the last month, we worked on our passion project. I knew the topic I wanted to work on for many weeks, but I was a little unsure whether I’d be able to find the data easily.

#####  My Topic  
During my last job at Kaiser, I worked with a team of teledermatologists who reviewed photos of skin abnormalities (e.g. skin lesions and rashes) and made assessments from the photographs. I wondered whether I could train a computer to do the same. I found a website called the “International Skin Imaging Collaboration Archive” that had 771 melanoma images and thousands of images of benign moles. This was awesome! I had labeled images and would be able to test out my question: Could I train my computer to detect the images of melanoma accurately?  
  
Here is an example of melanoma:

#####  It worked! Hallelujah  
Yes, there was a lot of blood, sweat and tears with this project; no pain, no gain. It was so amazing however when I was able to train my computer to achieve a high recall and precision score among all the images that I fed to it in my test set. I wished that I had had more images. Of course, the more images I had the better I could both test my model and train my model.
