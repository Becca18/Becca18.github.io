##  Can we detect melanoma in images of skin lesions?  

###  Passion Project Time!  
During the last month, we worked on our passion project. I knew the topic I wanted to work on for many weeks, but I was a little unsure whether I’d be able to find the data easily.

###  My Topic  
During my last job at Kaiser, I worked with a team of teledermatologists who reviewed photos of skin abnormalities (e.g. skin lesions and rashes) and made assessments from the photographs. I wondered whether I could train a computer to detect skin cancer in images of skin lesions: benign moles versus skin cancer.  

### The Data
The International Skin Imaging Collaboration Archive(https://isic-archive.com/) had 771 melanoma images and thousands of images of benign moles. This was awesome! I had labeled images and would be able to test out my question, which was a little more specific now, given my data. Could I train a computer to specifically detect *melanoma (the most deadly type of skin cancer)* in images of skin lesions?  
  
Here is an example of melanoma:

You may think this is a benign mole, which is what makes this problem so hard.  

###  It worked! Hallelujah  
Yes, there was a lot of blood, sweat and tears with this project; no pain, no gain. It was amazing when I was able to train my computer to achieve a high recall and precision score with a test set of images.
